# 📈 Finance Club — Open Project Summer 2024  
### **Pairs Trading Algorithm for Financial Markets**  
<!-- 📌 **Project ID:** FC24OPS2 -->

---

## 🔍 Overview
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a **pairs trading algorithm** to identify and exploit temporary mispricing between **correlated financial assets**.  
Pairs trading is a **market-neutral strategy** that takes simultaneous **long and short positions** in two related instruments, aiming to profit when their price relationship **converges back to equilibrium**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Develop a pairs trading strategy based on **statistical arbitrage** to identify cointegrated or mean-reverting asset pairs.  
2. Collect **historical price data** for a diversified universe of instruments — stocks, ETFs, futures, etc.  
3. Conduct statistical analysis to detect pairs with **high correlation or co-movement** over time.  
4. Design a trading algorithm to generate **buy/sell signals** based on threshold deviations in price spread.  
5. **Backtest** the strategy using historical data to evaluate profitability, consistency, and risk-adjusted return.  
6. Optimize algorithm parameters and signals through **iterative refinement** for improved robustness.

---

## 🔎 Scope
- Focus on implementing the strategy in a **specific market or asset class** (e.g., equities or crypto).  
- Support a range of **trading frequencies** — from intraday to multi-day timeframes.  
- Consider the use of **advanced enhancements**, including machine learning for dynamic signal generation and adaptability.

---

## 📦 Deliverables
- 🧠 **Pairs trading algorithm** implemented in a Python notebook with clear documentation of logic, inputs, and outputs.  
- 📊 **Backtesting report** with performance metrics, visualizations, and risk analysis.  
- 📘 **User guide / tutorial** covering usage instructions, signal interpretation, and parameter tuning.

## ⚠️ Constraints & Considerations

| **Challenge** | **Impact** |
|--------------|-----------|
| Historical data availability and quality | Requires extensive preprocessing and cleaning of datasets |
| Backtesting bias (e.g., survivorship bias, data mining bias, overfitting) | Necessitates robust validation techniques to ensure realistic performance evaluation |
| Computational complexity of the algorithm | May require optimization for speed, scalability, and efficient memory usage |
